1. Curses windows

The use of windows is a must for any user interface. As our interface gets
more and more complicated, we need to implement the use of windows. Our
interface needs the following windows:

T1.1 Cards on table
T1.2 Cards in player's hand
T1.3 Score table

The windows are to be redrawn at every function call.

T2. Color suits

Color suits differently for better readability.
